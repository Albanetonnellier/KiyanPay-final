            <p>So, how does one get a good credit score?</p>

        <p> <span class="citation">Why Should We Care About Financial Security?</span>

        Financial security is so much more than covering expenses. It's knowing how to budget, having healthy savings and being able to sleep through the night.</p>

        <p>Being financial secure removes the guilt and stress which can surround spending. Particularly during a pandemic when even national financial security was in question.</p>

        <p>The thing is, passive income isn't very passive at all. It's more like do all the work at once and then sit back and wait for the benefits to role in income. The thing about the passive income that we're sold online is that it is usually risky, or involves a big investment.</p>

            <p>Money can be pretty hard to earn, so when we do, we like to keep it to ourselves (unless we’re treating our loved ones of course!) Because it’s hard to earn a lot of people prefer to take other people’s rather than making their own.</p>

            <p>It’s not like the good ol’ days when you could just lock it all in a safe and then guard your safe day and night. Because now you keep your money online, so a lot of people might be able to access it without your knowledge.</p>
