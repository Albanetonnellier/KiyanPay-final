    <p lang="en">Small businesses have it tough most of the time. You're competing with larger chains with the
    resources and contacts to reach a larger audience, your audience. For a lot of small
    businesses, that makes loans very tempting. But do you really need one?</p><br>

    <p>There are a few steps that you can take to ensure that your loan is going to help boost your
    business and that you really do need it.</p><br>


<div class="mainpicture">

</div>

    <h2>1. What do I need it for?</h2>

    <p>Or, more precisely, Can I do it without it?</p><br>

    <p>You don't want to take out a loan unless you really can't do without it. It is an excellent way to
    add stress, risk and debt to your business so, it's completely unnecessary to do so if you don't
    have a precise aim.</p><br>

    <p>If you're not entirely sure what you're going to be using the money for before you've applied for
    or been approved for the loan, then maybe rethink why you're applying. Loans can be beneficial
    if they're used correctly. In order to do so, establish how you're planning on using every penny.
    Detail where it's going, how much it will contribute and what the result will be. This will also
    make your application more robust, so you're more likely to be approved.</p><br>

    <h2>2. Is there another way to get this money?</h2>

    <p>Consider a loan to be your last option. Can you secure funding from investors, family and
    friends, a business credit card? Or maybe you can free up funding from within the company-are
    you spending more than you need to on suppliers? This doesn't mean you should cut corners!
    But you shouldn't be overpaying either.</p><br>

    <p>That doesn't mean we're encouraging you to explore riskier options. You should only take/
    borrow money legally and safely. It is a good idea to draft up a payment plan and contract if
    you're borrowing from friends/family. It may seem unnecessary, but you don't want the stress of
    family relations to affect your business down the line.</p> <br>

    <h2>3. How am I going to repay this?</h2>


    <p>Borrowing money that you're not sure you can repay can run your business to the ground and
    ruin your future entrepreneurial plans.</p><br>

    <p>This is where your earlier plan comes in handy. Calculating how much you need and the return
    you're expecting (be modestâ€“it's better to be pleasantly surprised than left scrambling before a

    repayment is due) will tell you if the loan is worth it. This is especially true if you're using the
    loan to fund an expansion.</p><br>

    <p>Consider the terms of the loan. Ask yourself; Am I going to be able to make the repayments
    monthly? Would I prefer to start with smaller repayments and work my way up?</p><br>

    <h2>4. Is this the right loan for me?</h2>

    <p>So, you know that you need the loan, and there is no other way for you to source funding.
    You're also sure that, even if your plan doesn't go exactly smoothly, you'll still be able to repay
    it. Now what?</p><br>

    <p>You want to find the right loan for you. That depends on your business, industry, size of the
    company, product/service etc. It also depends on your business and personal credit history and
    the loan size that you'll need.</p> <br>

    <p>Keep an eye out for our future blogs on small business loans! We want to make sure that you're
    committing to the right one.</p>
