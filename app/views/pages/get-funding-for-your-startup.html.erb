    <p lang="en">Plenty of great ideas never get off the ground because their inventors don’t know how to sell
    them to the people that can fund their journey. We’ve compiled a list of tips for creating your
    funding presentation of your start-up.</p><br>

<div class="mainpicture">
    <img id="pic" class="center" src="https://i.ibb.co/644DnHX/startup2.jpg" alt="">
</div>

    <h2>1. Prepare</h2>

    <p>Selling is a key part of every start-up process, even before you’ve got your feet off the ground.
    When it comes to your sales pitch, there is no such thing as over-preparation. The more
    research you do and the more information that you can show that you have,
    the better. If you can convince the investors that you’re a knowledge source and know everything there is to
    know about your business, they are much likelier to trust you with their money!</p><br>

    <p>It is also a good idea to do some research on the investor and their company; have they
    invested in your sphere before? How did it go? How are you different? How are you better?</p><br>

    <p>Being able to answer every question that they have will immediately establish trust so make
    sure that you practice with a tough friend that can ask the hard-hitting questions and highlight where you need to improve.</p><br>

</div>

    <h2>2. Never Settle</h2>

    <p>Remember that, no matter how keen you may be to secure funding, you have to want to work
    with the investor as much as they want to work with you. A poor investor/investee relationship
    can kill a project very early on. It’s worth waiting for “Mr/Mrs Right” rather than rushing into a
    partnership with the wrong investors. It really is make or break.</p><br>

    <p>Like we mentioned before, this involves researching their previous investments to see where
    their expertise lies. An investor is much more than their monetary investment! If they have
    relevant experience then you can benefit from the partnership a lot more than if you just took out
    a loan.</p><br>

    <p>It’s also important that you click with them. Can you see yourself making tough business
    decisions with this person? Can you see yourself celebrating good business decisions with
    them? It all matters.</p><br>

    <h2>3. Devil in the details</h2>

    <p>You’re not going to be the first or last pitch that investors hear. They’re not going to enjoy
    vagueness so you want to add in all the details, or at least have them prepared if they ask.</p><br>

    <p>Include as much relevant information in your pitch as possible. This will save you and the
    investor time and they’ll be able to decide whether they’re interested in your start-up as soon as
    possible. Sales pitches are tiring!</p><br>

    <p>Here is a good place to remind you that the investor is going to be investing in you almost as
    much as they’re going to be investing in your idea. If they think that you’re being sneaky or that
    you’re messing them about at any point that will affect whether they want to invest in you/your
    idea.</p><br>

</div>

    <h2>4. Question Time</h2>

    <p>Q & A sessions are probably going to be the majority of your sales
    pitch. Be ready to have an intelligent and beneficial conversation outside of your scripted pitch. This is where research and
    practice come in handy-the tenth pitch will go a lot better than the first!</p><br>

    <p>You want to come across as being in control and knowing what you’re talking about. You need
    to know the answers to the big questions and the little ones, knowing how to answer them
    confidently is also helpful!</p>

    <p>Go through your pitch a lot, practice with anyone that will listen!</p><br>
