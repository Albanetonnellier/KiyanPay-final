    <p lang="en">Studying abroad can be a very interesting experience, but also an expensive one. Today, we’re
    going to we’re going to be listing some of the pros and cons of studying abroad in Italy to help
    you make up your mind.</p><br>



<div class="mainpicture">

</div>

    <h2>Language</h2><br>

    <p>Obviously! It’s a good idea to have at least a basic understanding of the language spoken in
    your preferred destination country. Living abroad for at least a year will definitely have a
    profound effect on your language speaking abilities but it’s also a good idea to have a
    beginner vocabulary to help you get settled and communicate adequately with potential friends/ teachers/
    roommates and locals.</p><br>

    <p>English is a language which is widely spoken in most countries, especially in Italy. However, it is
    a sign of respect to at least attempt to communicate in the international language. It will also
    help you integrate into social situations better as people won’t always be able to speak English
    in a larger group.</p><br>

    <h2>Modules</h2><br>

    <p>If you’re studying abroad through an English university then the chances are you’re going to
    have fairly similar module selections. Depending on the leniency of your university you might
    have to stick with modules that are relevant to your degree, or you might be able to try out some
    less relevant titles-this is more likely an option if your year abroad is in addition to three years
    domestically.</p><br>

    <p>If you’re only studying in Italy for a term or year that you’re probably going to have the option to
    enter English speaking modules. However, if you’re studying at an Italian university for your
    entire course you’re either going to have to go to an Italian-English university or you’re going to
    have to prepare your language skills!</p><br>

    <h2>Lifestyle</h2><br>

    <p>Italian culture is very different from that in England! A rich culture with a focus on fine dining,
    sophisticated entertainment and a healthy dose of admiration for an interesting history. If you’re
    preparing to studying in Italy, make sure that you’re penciling in enough time to eat, sing and
    explore.</p><br>

    <p>Unlike English universities, Italian universities don’t really have established campuses. The city
    that you’re based on is your campus! So, when you’re choosing whether you want to go abroad
    or stay home bear in mind that, depending on the size of the city that you’re staying in, there
    might be a lot more travel and exploration to do abroad.</p><br>

    <h2>Pros and Cons</h2><br>

    <p>Apart from the added cost of international tuition fees, studying abroad costs more on average
    than studying at a domestic university. You can get around this by applying for different grants
    and scholarships, whether through your domestic university, the one you’re applying to abroad
    or even both governments!</p><br>

    <p>There’s also a cultural adjustment to bear in mind. This is a pro as much as it is a con..</p><br>

    <p>Lastly, you’ll probably miss your family and friends but you can also enjoy making new
    connections in Italy!</p><br>

    <p>And don’t forget. Make the entire journey cheaper and easier by using your Bankiit card. Low
    exchange rates and transfer fees make us hard to beat...</p><br>
