  <h4>Scam Calls</h4> <br><br>
  <p>Scammers and Fraudsters are phoning people and pretending to be from various banks. So far, we haven’t had any reports of them impersonating our staff, so if you get approached by someone you think is falsely claiming to be part of the KiyanPay team, please let us know. In the meantime, here is how to tell if a phone call is genuine:

  <h2>What To Look Out For:</h2>
</div>

<section class="timeline">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <div class="text-area">
        <h6>- Are you expecting a call?</h6>
        <p>If you’re not, then it could be a scam. Banks don’t usually call unannounced, and they prefer to communicate via email or mail. If you’re not entirely sure, then end the call and redial the official number provided by your bank. </p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="text-area">
        <h6>- Are you being pressured?</h6>
        <p> We’re never going to pressure you into making a decision or performing an action, and no other bank will either. If you feel like the person on the other end of a call is asking you to do something quickly or secretly, then you’re not speaking to a representative of your bank. Make sure to report the call.  </p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="text-area">
        <h6>- Are you being asked to transfer money?</h6>
        <p> Scam callers are going to try and take as much money as quickly as possible. They may try to panic you and offer to transfer money out of your account to remedy a security breach to what they may term a safe/secure/holding account. Never do this. No bank will ask you to move money to a ‘safe’ account outside of your control. We can protect your money without moving it.  </p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="text-area">
        <h6>- Are you being offered a refund?</h6>
        <p> Banks cannot offer you refunds from other merchants, and they most likely wouldn’t call you to do so. Either way, if the offer is valid, it will still be good if you end the call and call back later on the official number, so there is no rush to act.  </p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="text-area">
        <h6>- Are you being asked to test a transaction?</h6>
        <p> No bank will need to test a transaction if you’re asked to do this end the call and let your bank know if you’ve handed over any details.  </p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="text-area">
        <h6>- Are you being called by the ‘police’?</h6>
        <p> It is extremely rare for the police or Scotland Yard to call, and they would never do so through an automated message. If they do call then, they’ll follow up with a visit from an officer with a photo ID and a warrant number, so you don’t have to answer anything on the call. Fines also do not get paid over the phone.  </p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="text-area">
        <h6>- Are you being asked to log on to your computer?</h6>
        <p>A scammer may ask you to log onto your computer to download something while pretending to be from a software or internet company. Do not trust these calls unless you specifically reached out for help. </p>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<div class="text-center">
  <h2>What can I do?</h2>
  <p>Cold calls are rare in the banking world as they are already swamped on their landline numbers and prefer to communicate through mail. But if you do get a call, here’s what to do:</p>
</div>

<section class="timeline">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <div class="text-area">
        <p>1. If you’re not sure who is calling and they can’t authenticate themselves, hang up. </p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="text-area">
        <p>2. If you’re not sure they’re genuine, then let them know you’ll call back, use a number that you trust rather than one they give you. If the caller is genuine, this won’t aggravate them at all. If they claim to be the police, call 101.  </p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="text-area">
        <p>3. Contact the alleged provider directly even if the number you were contacted from looks genuine.</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="text-area">
        <p>4. Never transfer any money; no official authority will ask you to transfer any money, ever.  </p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="text-area">
        <p>5. Do not log into anything they’re asking you to access unless you called them for help, and don’t allow them to take remote control of your computer. </p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="text-area">
        <p>6. Do not describe what is on your computer screen, and an authentic caller doesn’t need this information.  </p>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>

      <p>
        Make sure that you’re keeping an eye on your transactions. Scammers may take a large amount of money at once or take a lot of money in smaller increments. <br><br>
        If money appears in your account that you’re not expecting, then a scammer may have taken out a loan in your name. They may call you pretending to be your bank and ask you to move it to another account. If you do so, you may have to pay for the loan out of pocket later down the line. <br><br>
        Some scammers will target your overdraft; get in touch immediately if you notice it has been used without your permission or if the limit unexpectedly goes up. <br><br>
        Remember: If you’re not feeling sure or safe, hang up and call back. Our customer service team is more than happy to accommodate.
