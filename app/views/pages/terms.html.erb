		<h2>How to earn a referral credit</h2>

		<p>Existing KiyanPay users can earn a referral credit of 10 GBP (or equivalent*) towards a qualifying transaction if a friend and new KiyanPay user clicks on the unique referral link, or enters the unique referral code upon registration, and completes a qualifying transaction on the KiyanPay platform. There’s no limit to the number of referrals that each user can send or the number of referral credits they can earn, but only one referral code can be used per qualifying transaction. Referral codes can’t be used in combination with any other promotion code. It is also not possible to use promocodes/referral credits when sending money via a phone number.</p>

		<h2>What is a qualifying transaction?</h2>

		<p>A qualifying transaction must have a total sending value* of at least 100 GBP (or equivalent**), be to another country and in the case of the user receiving the referral, it must be their first transaction. If the first transaction of the user is less than the qualifying amount, the referral code can be used in a subsequent transaction with the same or higher total sending value as the qualifying amount. There is no expiry date on the referral code.</p>

		<h2>How to share referral codes</h2>

		<p>Referral codes should only be shared with people the user knows personally and should be shared on a platform where there’s a reasonable basis that the people are personal friends. KiyanPay reserves the right to deny the referral amounts if there’s suspicion of manipulation of the referral scheme, such as creating duplicate accounts with different contact details, sharing in unsolicited ways (spam) and anything else that KiyanPay deems to be not in good faith, abusive and a breach of this agreement.</p>

		<h2>Liability and governing law</h2>

		<p>These terms and conditions are in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, and KiyanPay reserves the right to change these terms and conditions and to terminate the referral scheme at any point in time. KiyanPay also accepts no liability for any use of the referral programme that does not comply with this agreement.
